# Prodigy Infotech Internship - Task 2

## Project Overview
- This is a simple Employee Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

## Authentication Mechanism
- JWT token-based authentication has been implemented to secure the application and ensure that only authorized users (admins) can access and perform actions.

## Admin Functionality
- The Admin can log in and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on employee data.

## Integration
- Seamless integration of front-end (React) and back-end (Node.js with Express) components, with MongoDB for data storage.

## Data Security
- User data and sensitive operations are secured with JWT tokens, ensuring proper access control and data protection.
